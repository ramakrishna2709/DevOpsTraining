>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Git and GitHub >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
	A quick aside: git and GitHub are not the same thing.
	 Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; 
	 GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git.
	 You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git.
	 There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket
