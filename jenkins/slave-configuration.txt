Values for following configurations must be mentioned for setting up the slave machine:

Description: The purpose of Node.
# of executors: The maximum number of concurrent build that Jenkins may perform on this agent.
Remote root directory: The path or directory of the agent machine(example: /home/machine1/jenkins).
Launch Method:  Launch Agenct via SSH

6.After selecting ssh methon, provide the Hostname of Slave machine and Credentails will be used with SSH with username along with Private Key.
   Key have to use from jenkins master private Key 
 save changes. 
7. Now, Login Jenkins Slave machine. Go to, Manage Jenkins ? Manage Nodes, we will find our created Node node1.


===============Aftet the configuration=========== Need to manadatory things set up == otherwise node will be offline=============

1. Install java
 sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
 
 2. Install git
   sudo yum install git curl wget
 3. Install maven( it depend on build project tools have to install) Ex: maven
  sudo yum install maven

8. Once its  done, you can verify the status of Node.. if everything will be fine, will get node status as online

9. Finally, go to required job configuration, you can add this Label for slave
10.it will build the job using slave server



===========================
SSH
Master ==>
==> ssh-keygen -t rsa
  
  
  ==> id.rsa  => private key
  ==> id.rsa.pub  => Pub key
  
 Slave : ==>
  copy the master pub key and paste in authorized_keys file
  permissions: chmod 600 authorized_keys
  move .ssh
  vi authorized_keys
   ==> should paste the pub key of master server
   
 ==> Master can able to connect with slave
 ssh username@Ipaddress
 
 ==> connection is ok.. we can able to access
 
 ==> jenkins node configuration==>  connection method with  login with ssh method
 
 
  need use with ssh username with master ssh privatekey
