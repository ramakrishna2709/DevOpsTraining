===================
Data sources allow data to be fetched or computed for use elsewhere in Terraform configuration. 
Use of data sources allows a Terraform configuration to make use of information defined outside of Terraform, or defined by another separate Terraform configuration.
=====================================================
Each provider may offer data sources alongside its set of resource types.

====================Using Data Sources
A data source is accessed via a special kind of resource known as a data resource, declared using a data block:

data "aws_instances" "example" {
  most_recent = true

 
  tags = {
    
    Name = "testing-*"
  }
}


10 ec2-isntances

tag:===  5
Name:
Role:
Environment: dev

5 instandes:

Enviornment: qa
Name: testing-1 testing-2 testin-4


ex:

# Find the latest available AMI that is tagged with Component = web
data "aws_ami" "web" {
  filter {
    name   = "state"
    values = ["available"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "tag:Component"
    values = ["web"]
  }

  most_recent = true
}
